### The product vision...

* imagines a product direction in the long term (two to five years, or more)
* represents the desired state for a product in the future
* articulates WHY the product exists, not HOW to reach those goals
* provides direction, guides prioritization, offers motivation

### Formulating the vision

Guide questions:

* Who is the **target audience**?
* Which customer **needs** can the product satisfy?
* Which **product attributes** determine the satisfaction of those needs?
* Who is **competing** and how do they perform? (internal, external competitors)
* What **timeframe** and product development **budget** determine the project?

### Possible sequence

1. Identify the target audience -- who will this product help? Prioritize. Existing pre-work (if any) on personas can be reused here.
1. Look at the current state -- needs, pain points, existing competition
1. List down the product attributes
    * Do this per target audience
    * What can the product do? Mark addressed needs or pain points
    * Prioritize
1. Review prioritization
    * Confirm most important needs and pain points are addressed by the highest priority items. Else, move up priority of items addressing most important items
1. Wrap up: Describe the visualized product or future mode of operations
1. Draft the vision statement that ties up with that.

### Vision statement

This can come in the format shared in Geoffrey Moore's book _Crossing the Chasm_:

* For (target customer)
* Who (statement of the need or opportunity)
* The (product name) is a (product category)
* That (key benefit, compelling reason to buy)
* Unlike (primary competitive alternative)
* Our product (statement of primary differentiation)
