# Starting in a new project

Your manager tells you that you are joining a project. Regardless of role, you'll need to find out stuff about your project and your would-be role.

_In case you are leading the project, also check [Project Initiation](pm-project-initiation.md)._


### Ask your staffing manager

* Project background
* Your role and allocation in the project
* Start and end dates of your initial allocation
* Logistics (work hours, location, shift)
* Contact person - who you’ll need to contact for more information about the project (This could be you if you’re the one being asked to kick-off or lead the project)


### General things to figure out

* What - scope, project objectives, what are you trying to build, what will be your role
* Why - background, purpose of project, purpose of your involvement
* Who - stakeholders, who will be your team mates, who will you be reporting to, escalation paths
* When - timelines, how long is your engagement in the project, what's the shift
* Where - location, where will the team stay, remote or collocated
* How - methodology, agile Scrum, agile Kanban, waterfall, team working agreements, team processes
* Extras - budget (travel allowances, shift allowances, charging setup e.g., wbs code)
