# Agile Rules of Thumb
But not really... because context matters... these are just some stuff I've googled in the past.


### Sprint ceremony timeboxes

| Event                | Time box
|----------------------|-
| Release Planning     | 6 hrs; done after every 2-3 months
| Backlog Refinement   | 1-2 hrs per wk
| Sprint Planning      | `2 hrs x sprint duration in weeks`
| Daily Scrum          | 15 mins
| Sprint Review        | `1 hr x sprint duration in weeks`
| Sprint Retrospective | `1 hr x sprint duration in weeks`


### Story points, stories per sprint

* 5 to 15 stories per sprint
* Most stories shouldn't take more than half the sprint to develop _and test._
* For a 2 week sprint, it's better if every story can be completed in 1 to 3 days
* 1 point story takes a day or two
* I've also know teams where a 1 point story would take less than half a day. For them, a 13 might not be too big.
* If a 1 takes more than a day, then 13 is probably too big.
* A sample of mapping points to hours **BUT** take note that a lot of the comments said this was a bad idea, not even Fibonacci series
  * 1 point ~ 2-4 hrs
  * 3 pts   ~ 4-8 hrs
  * 5 pts   ~ 8-16 hrs
  * 7 pts   ~ 16-24 hrs
  * 9 pts   ~ 24+
