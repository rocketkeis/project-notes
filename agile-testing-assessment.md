# Agile Testing Assessment

### Assessment - How agile is your testing?

Ref: http://www.growingagile.co.za/2015/10/assessment-how-agile-is-your-testing/

Score 1 point for each statement that is TRUE

1. The whole team is clear on what should be tested for each story and feature before any coding starts.
1. Before you discuss the solution, you make sure you understand the who and why behind any requirement.
1. You ask, and answer the question “How will we test that?” when discussing a user story.
1. Everyone on the team knows how to run the automated tests and read the results.
1. You discuss what you will automate at which level so that you don’t duplicate tests between the unit, component and UI levels.
1. Your test scripts are version controlled and labelled along with the source code, since tests are part of the working software.
1. You don’t have a bug database because you fix bugs as soon as you find them, instead of logging them.
1. When your continuous integration server fails, it is addressed and returned to a working state within an hour.
1. When observing your standup meeting an outsider would not be able to tell who is a developer and who is a tester.
1. Your team has a way to measure quality, which you use to identify if your testing process is working for you.

**0 – Great news…** You can only improve from here! Pick one thing in the list above to focus on for the next week.

**1 to 4  Pretty good…** You are thinking about testing in the right way, now just amp up some of those agile testing practices. Add one at a time so you don’t overwhelm the team, and look for the quick wins first.

**5 to 8  Nice work…** You should be sharing what you are doing with others, because you probably have a few of your own practices that we don’t know about.

**9 to 10  Awesome…** You are an agile testing rock star!
