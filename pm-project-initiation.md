* Get initial information on the project
  * Objectives, Scope, Timeline, Cost -- essentially ask what's been committed
  * Client background, internal/external, any history or past work with them?
  * Project background, any relevant history like past alternative solutions?
  * Risks, Assumptions, Dependencies
  * Find out what's in scope of the budget (e.g., infra, labor, taxi reimbursement, shift premium, etc.)
  * Identify reporting requirements, escalation paths
  * Identify Agile readiness of Customer -- to determine if Agile Overview by Agile Coach is required
* Find out who are allocated, and their R&Rs
  * Finalize staffing with Delivery Manager
  * Find out who'll handle the needed admin work of entering the project and staffing into the org's project management tool (e.g., could be Account Manager who enters the info, could be PM)
