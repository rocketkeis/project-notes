As opposed to waterfall projects wherein testers often join the project only later on (e.g., during Systems Integration Testing Phase), testers in Agile projects are usually added into the project along with the rest of the Scrum team. As such, expectations of the tester include:

* Familiarity with Agile Scrum
* Active participation in Agile Ceremonies (e.g., backlog refinement, release planning, sprint planning, daily scrum, sprint review, sprint retrospective)
* As a member of the Scrum cross-functional team, there may tasks that are not strictly testing related but if the tester has the capability and the capacity then they are encouraged to take on those tasks.

### Testing activities:

* Project initiation
    * Check the requirements for testing deliverables that are required by the contract.
    * Work with the rest of the team in defining the working agreements
    * Working agreements that would impact testing includes
        * Definition of Done
        * Workflow of the user story (when should it be groomed by the 3 amigos, when should you start testing it (and in which environment), how do you confirm that it is ready for testing, when do you pass the user story for sprint review)
        * Workflow of reported bugs (e.g., not all bugs have to be PO reviewed)
        * What's the scope of testing
    * Look into needed tools for the following:
        * Bug reporting - Do you use the same Agile tool (preferable)?
        * Test cases - Will you create test cases, and if so where/how will you maintain them?
        * Any other tools specific to what you'll be testing e.g., are there additional devices or licenses needed?
    * Start documenting testing guidelines, standards or conventions that are specific to the project. Examples of some past guidelines:
        * Draft test cases for user stories with size 5 or more.
        * Conventions on usage of priority/severity
        * Bug title naming convention
        * How to create or simulate test users

* Release planning
    * Don't just be a passive audience. Be attentive so that you can spot possible risks, esp for testing.

* Backlog grooming
    * Tester is one of the [three amigos](https://www.agilealliance.org/glossary/three-amigos/).
    * Contribute in the fleshing out of the Acceptance Criteria, create models (e.g., tables, diagrams) to capture possible cases to be considered.

* Sprint planning
    * Don't just be a passive audience. Be attentive so that you can spot possible risks, esp for testing.
    * During the discussion of the user stories, there might be details that will need to be considered in testing. Make sure that gets documented.
    * Participate in the sizing of user stories.

* Daily Scrum
    * As with any other member of the Scrum team, provide your updates.

* Sprint Review
    * Depending on working agreements, this could be a venue for user story demos. In past projects, testers had been asked to conduct the demo to the Product Owner so that's not off the table.

* Sprint Retrospective
    * As with any other member of the Scrum team, provide your inputs.


### These testing processes don't really go away

They're just ingrained within the Agile Scrum. Main metric is the completed user stories; so unless really necessary and it will guarantee improvement, minimize the overhead and focus on improving the product.

* Test management
* Test case management
* Defect management
