Derivative from the work of Tobias Holm Jensen in his Medium article [How to: user story mapping workshop](https://uxdesign.cc/how-to-user-story-mapping-workshop-448b58976ff) where he did say 'Please feel free to copy, steal and claim any content from this guide as I have created it for you.'


## Pre-work

* **Get a Decision-maker.**
  To foster progress and decision-making in the workshop, you’ll need one person that will have the responsibility of making decisions along the way. Typically, this would be the business owner of the project.

* **Find the right team.**
  I’d recommend finding 7-10 people to participate in the workshop. Make sure to include people with different roles and skill sets in your organization.

  Must-haves include the product owner, business owner, an engineer, a product designer and a researcher. When you invite these people, make sure to explain why their participation is important — this will create more buy-in.

  *Tip: to complete the workshop in 1 day (about 7 hours) do not involve more than 15 people.*

* **Get someone with the clear vision.**
  Ask someone from the leadership to define the long-term vision for the project. It shows your participants that your leadership is behind the project and that they consider it a priority.

* **Pick a Facilitator.**
  The facilitator will manage time, conversations, and the overall workshop activities. Look for someone who’s confident leading a meeting and synthesizing discussions on the fly. It might be you!

* **Create personas** (if you don’t have some already).
  Sit down with a (UX) researcher and create a persona template based on the data you have about the users and the product. This will help get everyone aligned from the beginning of the workshop, and these personas will be vital when you start putting together the journey.

* **Get the needed supplies.**
  * Post-its. 3 different colors: purple/dark blue, light blue and yellow.
  * Sharpies. Fine-point sharpies that are easy to read on a post-it from afar.
  * Timer. This will help visualizing how much time the participants have for each activity.

## During the Workshop

**Part 1 is for mapping** - listing the relevant users, their tasks, and what are needed to enable these. **Part 2 is for prioritization** - prioritizing the tasks in accordance to goals or strategy, identifying what would the "MVP" comprise of and further release plans.

## Part 1: Mapping

* **Introductions.** (10AM, 20 mins)
  If some people don’t know one another, do a round of introductions. Point out the Facilitator and the Decision-maker and describe their roles. Here, it would also be a good idea to include some kind of ice-breaker to loosen up the crowd and set the stage for creativity.

* **Explain the workshop.** (10:20AM, 10 mins)
  Describe the origin and purpose of user story mapping, the core activities and outline the process. Because it’s complex, people might not fully grasp what’s involved initially. Don’t worry if that’s the case. It will become clearer as you get into the different exercises.

* **Present the vision.** (10:30AM, 10 mins)
  Make the person you have decided to present the vision present. This is important to align the team with the outcomes, the expected value, the overall ‘why’ of the project from the get-go.

* **Frame your idea** ==this is from Jeff's book. Weigh if this should replace the previous step instead.==
  Why are you building this? Tell me about the benefits for you and for the people who will use this. What problems does it solve for those people and for you?

* **Present and rank user personas.** (10:40AM, 40 mins)
  List key (potential) users of the product. Ideally, you would use pre-made user personas from previous research (this is a big time-saver). Make sure to go over the goals and desired value for the user personas.

  *Tip: Ask the crowd if the persona descriptions lack anything. This will make them think about what they actually say.*

  After the presentation, rank the personas by priority and give each of them a different colored dot. This will be used for the later prioritization.

* **List the user tasks.** (11AM, 2 hrs up to end of part 1)
  To start the story mapping, ask everyone to individually write down on a post-it every step each user will take through the product — from their first touch to the point they leave.

  *Tip: keep it to 1 step per post-it and make them start with a verb.*

  Ask everyone to stick each post-it up on the wall in the order the personas will do the tasks (chronologically).

* **Organize the tasks into activities.**
  Move duplicative or similar ideas next to one another. Look for logical groupings within your line of user tasks, collecting together all the tasks that contribute to the user achieving a wider goal. Label these groups as overall activities (3–5 words).

* **List the stories.**
  Ask everyone to individually write down on a post-it everything that needs to be in place in your product to let the user achieve the goal of the activity. Each of these smaller units becomes the headline of a user story. It’s important these are written meaningfully.

* **Organize the story “stubs”.**
  As a team, post the stubs up under the user tasks, and the wider epic, that they apply to. If there are duplicates, choose the best and stick that up.

  You should have a comprehensive map by this stage. To make sure you do, get people to walk down the line to see if there are any gaps.

* **Give a one-hour break.** (1PM, 1 hr)

## Part 2: Prioritize
The objective of the second part is for everyone to discuss and define the minimum viable product. This is done by prioritizing all the stories into releases.

* **Focus on stories for one persona.** (2PM, 15 mins)
  Decide which stories mainly benefit one persona and stick that persona’s dot on those stories. Straight away you can see which stories offer the most to your most valued persona.

* **Prepare to do a MoSCoW.** (2:15PM)
  Stick up three horizontal strips of tape across the wall. Leave room between the strips. You’ll be grouping user story post-its into swim lanes between these lines. Next we decide which stories we Must, Should, Could, and Would do.

* **Move all Musts above the top line of tape.**
  While you’re at it, move all the other stories below the line, grouping them into Shoulds, Coulds and Won’ts. You can then arrange the user stories under the epic they help achieve.

* **Define your MVP.**
  You now have your stories ranked in priority from top to bottom. At the top, the collection of Musts is your Minimum Viable Product. It’s the first thing you’ll be working on (though not the only thing). Get the team to walk along the map and make sure these Musts are all and only the stories needed to produce a cohesive, standalone product that lets customers complete enough of their goals that they’ll adopt your offering.

  *Tip: You need a ruthless focus on including only the minimum in your Minimum Viable Product.*

## Next steps

The user story mapping workshop is a great tool for kicking off a project. But it will only be successful if you have a clear plan for how to use these insights. These are some buckets of ‘next steps’ that you could consider to follow as well.

* Refine the stories and plan.
* Design the solution.
* Set up weekly reviews of designs.
* Start planning for development.
