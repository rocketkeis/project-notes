title: Backlog Refinement
folder: agile

Reference for this is Chapter 16 of the book _User Story Mapping_ particularly the section on 'Story Workshop Recipe'. Ideally, this is done prior to the Sprint Planning so that the user stories to potentially be included have enough detail for the teams to size and implement.


The objective is to refine understanding and define specifically what the development team will build, and the acceptance criteria for what the team will build.

**Ahead of the session,** let the team know what stories will be discussed so they can also think of it in case they've got time before the session.

**Keep the session small to stay productive.** Three to five people is a good size.

**Include the right people.** For this conversation to be effective, include:

* Someone who understands users and how the user interface could or should work - PO, BA, UX Designer
* Someone familiar with the codebase you’ll be adding the features into, because they’ll best understand what's feasible to build - 1-2 Devs
* Someone to help ask the tough questions so that we consider the "what abouts" that others are often too optimistic to consider - Tester
* *Note that it's possible that one person wears multiple hats. That's ok as long as those 3 areas above are considered.*

**Dive deep and consider options.** Use the conversations to dive deep into:

* Exactly who the user is
* Exactly how we believe she would use it
* Exactly what it looks like—that is, the user interface
* Exactly how the software behaves underneath that user interface—those sticky business rules and data validation stuff
* Roughly how we might build the software—because we need to predict how long it will take to build—and happily, we’re making things real enough at this point we can more accurately predict how long that will take

*Remember that we need not consider anything absolutely required. If the discussion leads to solutions that are expensive or complex, step back and discuss the problems we’re really solving, and other alternatives we could build to solve them.*

**Agree on what to build.** After enough conversation to build shared understanding, move to answering the questions:

* What will we check to confirm this software is done?
* How will we demonstrate this software later when we review it together?

**Talk and doc.** Use whiteboards or flipchart paper to draw pictures, write examples, and consider options. Don’t let your decisions vaporize. Record them on a whiteboard or flipchart where everyone can see. Photograph notes and drawings and then transcribe them later.

**Speak in examples.** Wherever possible, use specific examples of what users do, exactly what data might be entered, exactly what users would see in response, or whatever examples best support your story.

**Split and thin.** When discussing details and thinking about development time, you’ll often find stories are larger than you like to put in a development cycle. Work together as a group to split up big stories, or “thin” out stories by removing unnecessary extras.

The backlog refinement session is not working when…

* No one participates—when one person describes what’s required and everyone else listens
* When we focus only on acceptance criteria and not telling the story about who does what and why
* When we fail to consider options both from a functional and technical perspective
