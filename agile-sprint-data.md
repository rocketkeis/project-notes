# Sprint Data

* (Nice-to-have) Create a page consolidating the info for the Sprint. In practice, I prepared this and used this as reference during Sprint Planning, and I also revise accordingly based on what was covered during Sprint Planning.
* (Nice-to-have) Create a page consolidating the data across the sprints. Here you can compare your team's trends for committed vs actual, or actual completed items over time.

## Each Sprint

* Sprint Goal
* Sprint Backlog
  * User stories that will be included in the Sprint
  * As for the plan (i.e., assignments, sub-tasks), they can be covered in Jira or whichever tool is used for user story and task management
* Schedule - sprint duration, milestones, holidays to note
* Team - members, availability
