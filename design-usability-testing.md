# Usability Testing

According to [Hotjar](https://www.hotjar.com/usability-testing/methods/), Usability testing is the practice of assessing the functionality and performance of your website or app by observing real users completing tasks on it. Usability testing lets you experience your site or app from the usersâ€™ perspective so you can identify opportunities to improve the user experience.

### Plan

* Identify goals or what you need to find out with the usability tests
* Identify the type of usability testing you need based on your goals - check out [Five Types of Usability Testing](https://measuringu.com/five-types-usability/)
* Identify if the data you need is confidential or would require a written agreement between the users and secure them as necessary
* Identify scope - which screens, which features will be involved, will it be action / task based or will it be exploratory
* Identify who will be involved - facilitators, target users
* Identify how it will be conducted - will it be a guided 1-1 session or a remote session, will it be deployed and then people will give feedback, will it be guerilla testing
* Identify what data and how data will be captured - What kind of data do you need, what questions will you ask to get that data, how can notes be effectively/efficiently captured - depending on the kind of test you will conduct - will you be using online forms, or in one-on-one sessions will you simply scribble in the notepad, how and where will feedback be captured, how will you organize the data captured to something usable
* Identify timelines, tools, and logistics needed - How long is the test, will you need a specific phone, a specific venue, etc.
* Identify outputs of this exercise - usability report, recommendations on additional user stories, insights

### Conduct

_Depends on planned approach_

Check out [Usability Testing Methods](https://www.hotjar.com/usability-testing/methods/) and [Five Types of Usability Testing](https://measuringu.com/five-types-usability/) to learn more

Remember that usability tests can be:
* Moderated in-person - Facilitator is co-located with the user
* Moderated remote - Teams / Skype
* Unmoderated remote - Online forms

Depending on your goal, the tests can be:
* Action/Task oriented - (i.e. How will you login, how will you register)
* Exploratory - To understand how the user explores and sees your application (i.e. is it confusing to navigate, what do they notice, etc)

### Review

* After 1 or 2 runs, review approach and identify needed tweaks. Confirm that you are getting the information you had set out to capture. If you're getting other interesting information that you'd like to continue capturing, tweak the materials to include it.

### Closing

* Prepare and deliver the report.
* Capture lessons learned from the whole exercise for benefit of future usability testing sessions.
