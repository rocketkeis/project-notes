### Comparison with Scrum

Scrum in a nutshell - Split your organization, split your work, split time,
optimize release plan, optimize the process through retrospectives

Kanban in a nutshell - Visualize the workflow (split work), limit work in
progress (WIP), measure the lead time (average time to complete one item),
optimize to reduce lead time and make it predictable

| | Scrum | Kanban |
|-|-|-|
| Roles | 3 roles (PO, SM, Team) | -
| Timeboxed iterations | Prescribed | Can have separate cadences for planning, release, and process improvement. Can be event-driven instead of timeboxed.
| Limiting WIP | Limited indirectly per sprint | Limited directly per workflow state
| Adding items | Cannot add items to an ongoing iteration | Can add new items whenever capacity is available
| Commitment | Team commits to a specific amount of work for the iteration | -
| Board reset | A scrum board is reset between each sprint | A kanban board is persistent
| Cross-functional teams | Prescribed | Optional. Specialist teams allowed.
| Board ownership | A sprint backlog is owned by 1 specific team | A kanban board may be shared by multiple teams or individuals
| Story size | Items must be broken down so they can be completed within 1 sprint | No particular item size is prescribed. Minimizing lead time incentivizes breaking down to smaller parts. |
| Estimation | Prescribed | -
| Default metric for planning and process improvement | Velocity | Lead time
| Prioritization | Prescribes a prioritized product backlog | Optional |
| Daily meetings | Prescribed | - |
| Charts | Burndown chart | -
